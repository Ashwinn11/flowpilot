# 🧪 Dashboard Functionality Test Guide

## ✅ What's Now Working

### Real Data Integration
- **Task Loading**: Fetches real tasks from Supabase for today's date
- **User Profile**: Shows real user name from OAuth metadata
- **Dynamic Stats**: Progress, focus time, and completion rates based on real data
- **Empty State**: Shows helpful message when no tasks exist

### Task Management
- **Add Tasks**: Creates real tasks in Supabase with smart scheduling
- **Complete Tasks**: Updates task status and logs completion
- **Skip Tasks**: Increments skip count and logs skip action
- **Delete Tasks**: Removes tasks from database
- **Update Tasks**: Modifies task properties

### User Experience
- **Loading States**: Shows spinner while fetching data
- **Error Handling**: Toast notifications for success/error states
- **Real-time Updates**: UI updates immediately after database changes
- **Smart Scheduling**: Automatically finds free time slots

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Test Task Creation
1. Click "Add Task" button
2. Fill in task details (title, duration, priority)
3. Submit the form
4. **Expected**: Task appears in list, toast shows success

### 2. Test Task Completion
1. Click checkbox on any task
2. **Expected**: Task shows as completed, progress updates

### 3. Test Task Skipping
1. Right-click task → "Skip"
2. **Expected**: Task status changes to skipped, skip count increases

### 4. Test Task Deletion
1. Right-click task → "Delete"
2. **Expected**: Task disappears from list

### 5. Test Empty State
1. Delete all tasks
2. **Expected**: Shows "No tasks for today" with CTA button

### 6. Test Real-time Updates
1. Open dashboard in two browser tabs
2. Add task in one tab
3. **Expected**: Task appears in both tabs (if using real-time)

## 🔧 Database Verification

### Check Supabase Tables
1. **tasks table**: Should show created tasks with proper user_id
2. **task_logs table**: Should show action logs for each operation
3. **user_profiles table**: Should show user profile created on first login

### Verify Data Integrity
- Task user_id matches authenticated user
- Task timestamps are in UTC
- Skip counts increment properly
- Completion timestamps are set correctly

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Tasks not loading"
- Check user authentication
- Verify Supabase connection
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure RLS policies allow user access

### "Task creation fails"
- Check required fields (title, duration, priority)
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check Supabase logs for insert errors
- Ensure task service is properly imported

### "UI not updating"
- Check if state updates are working
- Verify callback functions are passed correctly
- Check for JavaScript errors in console
- Ensure toast notifications are working

### "Performance issues"
- Check if tasks are being fetched efficiently
- Verify no unnecessary re-renders
- Check if loading states are working
- Monitor Supabase query performance
