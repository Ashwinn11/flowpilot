Supabase Client Configuration: Proper setup with autoRefreshToken: true, persistSession: true, and detectSessionInUrl: true\n2. Auth State Management: Context properly manages user state with cleanup and memory leak prevention\n3. Session Persistence: Automatic session restoration on page reload via getSession()\n4. Real-time Auth Listening: onAuthStateChange properly handles sign-in/sign-out events\n5. Background Profile Creation: User profiles created automatically on sign-in\n6. Protected Routes: Implemented with loading states and proper redirects\n\nðŸ”§ AREAS FOR ENHANCEMENT:\n1. Token Storage Security: Currently using browser default storage - could enhance with HttpOnly cookies\n2. Session Expiration Handling: Could add explicit session timeout warnings\n3. Multi-tab Session Sync: Could improve coordination across browser tabs\n4. Session Health Monitoring: Could add periodic session validation\n\nðŸŽ¯ IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:\nSince the current implementation is already robust and follows Supabase best practices, I'll focus on:\n1. Adding session health monitoring\n2. Improving session expiration handling\n3. Adding session security headers\n4.
