FlowPilot — Project Requirements Document (PRD)
📌 Overview
FlowPilot is an AI-powered productivity assistant that integrates calendar events, user input (text/voice), and behavioral analytics to help individuals plan their day effectively. It combines automation with human intent by intelligently prioritizing, scheduling, and rescheduling tasks based on time availability, task nature, and productivity patterns.

🎯 Goals
Help users focus on the right tasks at the right time

Automate task rescheduling intelligently when skipped

Detect productive hours based on actual completions

Maintain a lightweight, minimal UX inspired by YC/Airbnb

Start as a PWA with a scalable path to native iOS/Android apps

🧑‍💻 Target Users
Tech-savvy professionals, solopreneurs, creators

People who schedule by calendar but lack daily execution clarity

Users who want AI to guide productivity but retain control

💡 Core Features
1. Calendar Integration
🔗 Google Calendar & Outlook OAuth

📅 Pull calendar events (read-only)

📌 Tag with priority & archetype (deep/admin/creative/reactive)

🤖 If tags not provided, detect via GPT

⏳ Schedule based on free time, priority, archetype, and productive hours

🔁 Retry logic for skipped tasks based on skip count, archetype, urgency

3. Daily Planner View
